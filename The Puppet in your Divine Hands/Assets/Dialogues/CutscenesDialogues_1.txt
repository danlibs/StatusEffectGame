It's been days since I was thrown in this place...
I feel tired...
God has abandoned me...
[title=IntroCutscene2]
No... That can't be.
I'm a faithful man!
I know God can hear me.
[title=IntroCutscene3]
I will beg for my life,
and God will save me from this hole.
I know They will.
[title=IntroCutscene4]
OH LORD! PLEASE SAVE ME!
RECEIVE MY BODY
AND DO WHATEVER IS THY WILL!
CONTROL ME AND, PLEASE,
LEAD ME OUT OF THIS PLACE!
[title=IntroCutscene5]
Now, I shall wait for thine actions.

Huh... 
I'm nothing but a fool...
God is not listening.
[title=Final02]
Maybe They don't even exist...
I'll just stay here then...
And probably die of starvation.

My body hurts...
With these wounds I may never have a normal life again...
But...
Am I... free?...
I'm actually alive and free...
[title=Final12]
Lord, I'm wounded, but grateful.
Maybe You tried to teach me a lesson...
Everything has a price.
Thou tookest my body and hast led me out of this place,
but, even free, my life shall change.
I humblely thank thee.

[title=Final21]
Oh my God...
That's a miracle!
I'm here, alive and without pain!
[title=Final22]
Lord, I thank thee!
Thou art my savior!
Beyond it, I think thou art my friend.
Thank you VERY much, Lord!
[title=Final23]
Bye! See you later!

As God, you can make the puppet walk (A and D keys), jump (Space) and enter doors (W key).
[title=Tutorial2]
Use the sliders to control his mass and speed.
Remember: greater mass equals lower jumps, and vice-versa.
Greater speed equals longer jumps, and vice-versa.

You can set the fool on fire as well, just press this button.
Although evil, it can be useful! Just... be careful with it.
