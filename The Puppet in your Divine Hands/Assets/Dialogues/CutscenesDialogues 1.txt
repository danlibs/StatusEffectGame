Days have long gone since I was thrown in this place...
I feel tired...
God has abandoned me...
[title=IntroCutscene2]
No... It can't be.
I'm a faithfull man!
I know God is listening now.
[title=IntroCutscene3]
I should beg for my life,
and God shall save me from this hole.
I know They will.

OH LORD! PLEASE SAVE ME!
RECEIVE MY BODY
AND DO WHATEVER IS THY WILL!
CONTROL ME AND, PLEASE,
LEAD ME OUT OF THIS PLACE!
[title=IntroCutscene5]
I shall wait for thine actions now.
